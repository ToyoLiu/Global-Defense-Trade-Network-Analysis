### Lords of War: A Global Arms Trade Analysis

**Brief Description:**  
Analyzed global arms trade data using network analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning to uncover key patterns and trends in the international arms market, with a focus on the role of the United States as a supplier.

**Time Period:**  
Apr 2024

**Tools:**  
Python, Neo4j, NetworkX, Py2Neo, Scikit-learn, CatBoost, SHAP, NLP (nltk), Jupyter Notebook

**Key Achievements:**
- Conducted comprehensive data acquisition and cleansing, transforming raw SIPRI arms trade data into a structured format suitable for analysis.
- Performed network analysis using Neo4j and Python, identifying key suppliers and recipients in the global arms trade, with a focus on the United States, Soviet Union, and other major players.
- Implemented natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze transaction comments, extracting key themes and visualizing them using word clouds and clustering methods.
- Developed predictive models using CatBoost and Naive Bayes to classify whether the United States was the supplier in a given arms trade, achieving high accuracy through careful feature engineering and model optimization.
- Created an interactive web-based user interface to visualize the findings and make the analysis accessible to educators, policymakers, and researchers.
